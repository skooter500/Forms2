This Jet Engine Flames pack provides a collection of effects for your jet aircaft.

5 variations of jet flames are provided to suit any taste or engine type. Smoke particles and audio are also included to complete the effect.

Simply load the example scene - Jet_Engine_Flames.unity - or drag one of the Jet_Engine_Flames prefabs from the Prefabs folder onto your aircraft node in the Hierarchy window. Then move (and potentially scale) the effect so that it sits correct with the vehicle. Repeat this to add the Jet_Engine_Engine_Smoke_Particles Jet_Engine_Smoke_Audio effects.

Have fun!
